# Airline Delay Performance Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes airline delay performance for December 2019 and December 2020 using Power BI. The dashboard focuses on operational efficiency, delay causes, carrier comparison, and overall performance metrics.

## Objectives
- Measure overall delay rate and cancellation rate
- Identify top carriers with highest delay rates
- Analyze average delay duration
- Break down delay causes (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft)
- Evaluate operational vs non-operational delays

## Key KPIs
- Total Flights: 997K
- Delay Rate: 17%
- Cancellation Rate: 1%
- Average Delay Minutes: 65.4
- Operational Delay Percentage: 72%

## Dashboard Pages

### Page 1 – Performance Overview
- Carrier Delay Rate Ranking
- Top 5 Carriers by Delay Rate
- Total Delay Minutes by Carrier (Stacked by Delay Type)

### Page 2 – Delay Cause & Operational Analysis
- Delay Cause Contribution
- Operational Delay % by Carrier
- Overall Operational Delay %

## Data Preparation
- Data cleaned and transformed using Power Query
- Delay types structured for stacked analysis
- Measures created using DAX for:
  - Delay Rate %
  - Operational Delay %
  - Ranking
  - Aggregated delay metrics

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX
- Data Modeling

## Key Insights
- 72% of delays are operational in nature
- Late aircraft and carrier delays are the dominant causes
- Certain carriers consistently show higher delay rates
- Average delay duration exceeds 65 minutes

## Skills Demonstrated
